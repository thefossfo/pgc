# Personal Ground Control (PGC)

## About
The Personal Ground Control System, or PGC, aims to enable everyday users as well as hobby rocket enthusiasts and even professionals with minimum funding to monitor rocket launches like the pros.

## Existing features
The current setup for PGC consists of a screen and a camera. That could be a phone, tablet, etc, but the prototype uses a laptop and a USB webcam. It uses Apache Web Server to serve static HTML, CSS and JavaScript that is displayed in a fullscreen browser window.

The window is broken up into 4 quads, each one displaying relevant information about the launch.
